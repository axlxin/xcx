In this scenario, you would create two requirements: Product Name Contains iPod, and Product Model Contains iPod.  Now the shipping rate will become available if a product within the cart contains the phrase “iPod” within either the product name or the product model.</p><h4>All Requirements Below Must Be Satisfied</h4><p>This type of situation would occur if you have one or more requirements that must be met in order for the shipping rate to appear.</p><p>Example: You have a free shipping rate that requires the cart total to exceed $100.00, but the cart weight cannot exceed 20kg.  In this scenario, you would create two requirements: Cart Total Greater Than Or Equals 100, and Cart Weight Less Than Or Equals 20.</p><h4>None of the Requirements Below Must Be Satisfied</h4><p>This option is useful when dealing with situations where you don’t want any of the requirement settings to be met.  If any one of the requirement settings is met, the shipping rate will return false.</p><p>Example: A shipping rate that cannot exceed a cart length of 50cm, cart width of 75cm and a cart height of 100cm.  In this scenario, you would create three requirements: Cart Length Greater Than Or Equals 50, Cart Width Greater Than Or Equals 75, and Cart Height Greater Than Or Equals 100.</p>';
