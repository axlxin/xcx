<div>
	Features:</div>
<ul>
	<li>
		By using 32-bit high speed CPU,it accelerate processing speed, control more accurately,operating more steadily)</li>
	<li>
		Even if you know nothing about programing,as long as you can use your mouse,you are able to make your robot dancing.</li>
	<li>
		Perfect off-line operation function, without external MCU, no need to connect the PC,it can run thousands of action</li>
	<li>
		Automatic identification of baud rate(9600,19200,38400,57600,115200,128000)</li>
	<li>
		USB and TTL serial port using different IO to handled separately, avoided any interference.</li>
	<li>
		After action group performed,it will return to "AGF \ r \ n", so that we can test action group if it has finished, in order to follow other orders.</li>
	<li>
		After a single command,it will return to"# CC \ r \ n", for example, if you send "p1500 # 2 # 3 p1500t1000 \ r \ n", after a control panel performed, it will return "# CC \ r \ n" to said is performed.</li>
