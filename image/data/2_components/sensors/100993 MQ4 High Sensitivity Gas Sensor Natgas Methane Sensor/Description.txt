Product description:

Sensitive material of MQ-4 gas sensor is SnO2, which with lower conductivity in clean air. When the 
target combustible gas exist, The sensor¨s conductivity is more higher along with the gas concentration 
rising. Please use simple electrocircuit, Convert change of conductivity to correspond output signal of 
gas concentration. 

MQ-4 gas sensor has high sensitity to Methane, also to Propane and Butane. The sensor could be 
used to detect different combustible gas, especially Methane, it is with low cost and suitable for different 
application. 

Feature:

High sensitivity to Combustible gas in wide range 

High sensitivity to Natural gas、Methane、Coal gas、CO etc gas
