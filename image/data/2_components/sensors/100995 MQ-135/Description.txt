Specification features:

Main chip: LM393,MQ-135 gas sensor

Operating voltage: DC 5V

With signal output indicator instructions.

Dual signal output (analog output, and TTL level output).

TTL output valid signal is low level,  (output low signal light, which can be accessed microcontroller IO port).

analog output increases with gas concentration, the higher the concentration,the higher the voltage .

high sensitivity with Sulfide, benzene vapor, and other harmful gases.

with a long service life and reliable stability.

Size:32mm x 22mm x 27mm(L x W x H)

Package content:

1 x MQ-135 sensor module.
