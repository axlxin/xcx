Product description:

Sensitive material of MQ-9 gas sensor is SnO2, which with lower conductivity in clean air. It make 
detection by method of cycle high and low temperature, and detect CO when low temperature (heated 
by 1.5V). The sensor¡¯s conductivity is more higher along with the gas concentration rising. When high 
temperature (heated by 5.0V), it detects Methane, Propane etc combustible gas and cleans the other 
gases adsorbed under low temperature. Please use simple electrocircuit, Convert change of conductivity 
to correspond output signal of gas concentration. 

MQ-9 gas sensor has high sensitity to Carbon Monoxide, Methane and LPG. The sensor could be 
used to detect different gases contains CO and combustible gases, it is with low cost and suitable for 
different application. 

Feature:

Good sensitivity to CO/Combustible gas 

High sensitivity to Methane, Propane and CO 

Long life and low cost
