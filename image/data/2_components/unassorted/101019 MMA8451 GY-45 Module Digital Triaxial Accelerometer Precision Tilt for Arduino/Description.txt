Description:

MMA8451Q is a 14-bit resolution with a smart low-power , three-axis , capacitive micromachined accelerometer. The acceleration sensor embedded with rich functionality , user-programmable options with flexible and can be configured with up to two interrupt pins . Embedded interrupt function can save the overall power consumption , relieve the burden on the host processor constantly polling data . Along with low-pass filtering the data access functionality and high- pass filtering of data, data analysis may be required to minimize , in order to achieve shake detection and rapid response . The device can be configured to use any combination of configurable features embedded inertial wake-up interrupt signal is generated , which makes MMA8451Q monitoring events while at rest to maintain a low -power mode .
