Feature:

Module device uses high-frequency specifications inductor-capacitor, crystal 10ppm high precision specifications ensure that the module wireless features are adequately represented.

All modules have been professional equipment testing, consistency and stability of the modules are fully protected.

SPI interface, small size dimensions, stamp holes convenient interface, embedded design, the full expansion of distance

With a shield, better anti-interference performance
