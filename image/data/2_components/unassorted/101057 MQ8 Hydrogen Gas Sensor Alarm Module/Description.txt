Features:

using high-quality dual-panel design, with a power indicator and TTL signal output instructions;

with the DO switch signal (TTL) output, and AO analog signal output;

TTL output valid signal is low. (When the low output signal light can be connected directly to the microcontroller or relay module)

0 ~ 5V analog output voltage, the higher the concentration, the higher the voltage.

there have four screw holes for easy positioning;

Size: 32 (L) * 20 (W) * 22 (H)

with a long life and reliable stability

rapid response and recovery characteristics

operating voltage: 5V
