 A big sister to our EL tape, the EL panel is a similar item that comes in a 10 cm square format.  You¡¯ll notice when working with it that it shares some of the same features as the EL tape:  flexibility, portability, and a beautiful soft glow.  It can be used as backlight for an illuminated device, or a platform for paper-cutting artwork.  Post it on a flat surface or wrap it around a curved surface.  Use it in a project as a lighting element or attach it to a shirt.  The options are amazing.
 
You need an inverter to drive the EL light, to control it, please pick up an EL Shield.
