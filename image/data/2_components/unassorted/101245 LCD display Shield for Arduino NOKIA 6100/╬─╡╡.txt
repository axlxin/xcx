101245 Arduino LCD display LCD Shield for Arduino 685 SHD_LCD_NOKIA

Introduction 
This 128x128 mini color LCD is a perfect match for the portable application. It is designed to repalce a broken screen in a cell phone. So the connector was not designed for multiple attachment/detachment. Please be gentle and handle with care. 
This inexpensive LCD comes with a powerful white LED backlight and a relatively simple serial interface. It's a 9-bit interface, so beware. But we were able to get the LCD up and running on a LPC2138 with a few hours worth of work.
