Product Descriptions:

4.0 ~ 40 v input voltage (input voltage must be higher than output voltage of 1.5v above.)
Low output voltage adjustable range 1.25 V ~ 37 V adjustable (input voltage must be higher than the output voltage of 1.5 V)
Maximum output current can be as high as 3A, normal working current is in 2A.
Low with voltmeter, according to the use of advanced microprocessor, voltmeter error is + / - 0.05 V, the range of 0 ~ 40 V.(note: to ensure the voltage meter's accuracy, please make sure that the input voltage is higher than 4 v)
Low power light
Low light touch on the right side of the button can change measuring input or output voltage, and a light show which way are measuring voltage, and save the Settings, even without electricity to boot
Low voltage meter can be closed, when don't need to touch the left side of the button can easily implement
With terminal blocks, no soldering iron can also ease of use, and keep welding line connection point
Using the internal oscillation frequency 150 KHZ, the second generation of switch voltage regulator, low consumption, high efficiency.
Low overheating protection and short circuit protection function
