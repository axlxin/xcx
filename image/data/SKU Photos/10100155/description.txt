Product Descriptions:

Maximum output current 3A, stable output 2.1A. No need care about heat when input 12V and output 2A.
Low ripple wave, 12V to 5V only 10mV. 
High converting ratio, 6.5V converts to 5V 0.7A the ratio is 97.5%. Keeps the heat in the very very low level.
A 1.5A fuse is assembled on the input port, and 5V 300W TVS tube as overload protection.
Small size, dimension 26.4x15x7.4mm.
Very low no-load power, only 0.85mA.
