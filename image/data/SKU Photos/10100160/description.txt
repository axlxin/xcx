Product Descriptions:

This is a high-performance switching current 4A upgrade module. The module uses the second generation of high-frequency switching technology XL6009E1 chip, higher performance than the first generation LM2577 with lower cost. 
Wide input voltage 3V ~ 32V, optimum operating voltage range is 5 ~ 32V;
Wide output voltage 5V ~ 35V;
Built-in 4A efficient MOSFET switch, rise the conversion efficiency up to 94%; (LM2577 current is only 3A)
Ultra-high switching frequency 400KHz, you can use a small-capacity filter capacitors get very good effect, the ripple is even lower than LM2577. (LM2577 frequency only 50KHz)
