Descriptions:

This power module is a new version module, with larger inductance, better heat cooling system, working more stable.

Specifications:

Input voltage: 5-30 v
Adjustable output voltage: 1.25 V - 26 V
Adjustable output current: 0.2 A - 2 A
Size: 3.8 * 5.5 * 5.5 CM (width)
Limitation: input maximum 32 v, output current 2.6 A
Take care of the heat cooling when you make the module full load work. 
Constant voltage ripple: 50 mv, 52 khz ripple
