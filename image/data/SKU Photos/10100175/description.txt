Product Details:

Signal Generator Module
Condition: New
Scope of this module:
1 Used as a square wave signal generator generates a square wave signal used for experimental development.
2 To drive a stepper motor for generating a square wave drive signal.
3 Adjustable pulse generated for MCU.
4 Adjustable pulse generation, control circuitry associated

Descriptions:

1 Size: approx.3.1CM * 2.2CM
2 Main chip: NE555;
3 Input voltage: 5V-15VDC. When 5V power supply, the output current can 15MA around; When 12V power supply, the output current can 35MA around;
4 Input current: ¡Ý 100MA
5 Output range: 4.2V V-PP to 11.4V V-PP. (Different input voltage cause different output)
6 Maximum output current: ¡Ý 15MA (when 5V power supply, V-PP greater than 50%), 
¡Ý 35MA (when 12V power supply, V-PP greater than 50%)

Advantages:

1 Output with LED indication, easy to see(low volume LED will light, high volume LED will off, LED flash when frequency is relatively low);
2 Output level selectable frequency range, the output frequency is continuously adjustable;
LF file: 1Hz ~ 50Hz
IF file: 50Hz ~ 1kHz
Medium-high frequency file: 1KHz ~ 10kHz
HF file: 10kHz ~ 200kHz
3 The output duty cycle can fine-tune, duty cycle and frequency can not separately adjustable, adjusting the duty cycle will change the frequency
4 Output frequency is adjustable;
Period T = 0.7 (RA +2 RB) C
RA, RB is 0-10K adjustable;
LF file C = 0.001UF;
IF file C = 0.1UF;
Medium-high frequency file C = 1UF;
HF file C = 100UF, so you can count the frequency of the waveform 

Package Included:

4 x Signal Generator Module
