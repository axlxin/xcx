Module Interface Description:

VCC: positive power supply 3.3-5V
GND: tied to power supply
DO: digital output module has output low magnetic induction is
AO: Hall real-time voltage output
Hall sensor module
For magnetic field detection

Sensor uses 3144E Hall Switch Sensor:

Module has two outputs:

1. AO, Hall real-time output
2. DO, the Hall signal after the comparator output adjustment
